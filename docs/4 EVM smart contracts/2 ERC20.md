# ERC20

Starport and the Cosmos SDK support to create more than just one token on your blockchain, by specifying this with starport in your `config.yml` or in general in your `genesis.json` file. These tokens can only be manipulated by approval of the validators that run the blockchain. In case you want entities using your blockchain to be able to create their own tokens, the ERC20 Standard is a great fit.
We have several choices how to execute smart contracts with the Cosmos SDK. In the following chapters we will explore how to use the ERC20 standard on Ethermint with Solidity and on CosmWasm with Rust.

## Smart Contracts on Cosmos

In order to understand more details about smart contracts, it makes sense to look at the most popular and used smart contract, the ERC20 (and following ERC777). The ERC20 contract is the standard on the EVM to allow users to create their own token on a smart contract basis. This token is usually finite in supply, have fixed decimal places and are transferable on the blockchain it is uploaded on. 
Therefore the most important functions an ERC20 uses are

- `function decimals() public view returns (uint8)`
```solidity
uint8 public decimals;                //How many decimals to show.
```

- `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)`
```solidity
function EIP20(
    uint256 _initialAmount,
    string _tokenName,
    uint8 _decimalUnits,
    string _tokenSymbol
) public {
    balances[msg.sender] = _initialAmount;               // Give the creator all initial tokens
    totalSupply = _initialAmount;                        // Update total supply
    name = _tokenName;                                   // Set the name for display purposes
    decimals = _decimalUnits;                            // Amount of decimals for display purposes
    symbol = _tokenSymbol;                               // Set the symbol for display purposes
}
```

- `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)`
```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value); //solhint-disable-line indent, no-unused-vars
    return true;
}
```

To make it work in production we still need a few other functions and more code for edgecases. The whole contract for the ERC20 can be read on [Consensys ERC20](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/fdf687c69d998266a95f15216b1955a4965a0a6d/contracts/eip20/EIP20.sol) or [OpenZeppelin ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/9b3710465583284b8c4c5d2245749246bb2e0094/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) and the specification is available under https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20.

If you are desired to learn more about smart contracts, understanding the ERC20 specification and code gives an important insight, as the code is short and clear. It probably is the most battle-tested smart contract with dozens of implementations and millions of transactions that have used it. ERC20 on the EVM has a few edgecases that have been overcome by ERC777 - which adds important usability functions to the ERC20.
You can research which functions are added and why by [Dexaran](https://medium.com/@dexaran820/erc20-token-standard-critical-problems-3c10fd48657b).

## ERC20 on Ethermint

Ethermint is the Cosmos SDK module that allows to replicate the EVM. We can load solidity contracts onto the Cosmos SDK blockchain. Let us examine an example usage of Ethermint with the ERC20 Token.

Working with Ethermint can come in different forms. You can either work with the official [Ethermint chain](https://ethermint.zone/), fork from the [Ethermint Codebase](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ethermint) or use the EVM Module in your own Cosmos SDK application. The last option is what we will be looking into. We have created our Cosmos SDK template with Starport and we can just add the Ethereum Virtual Machine to our application and allow smart contracts to be created in Solidity and uploaded to the blockchain.

[Read how to integrate the `evm` module into your Cosmos SDK application.](05_extras/05_01_cosmos_entermint/05_01_cosmos_ethermint.md)

On GitHub you can also find the `ethapp` application which you can fork and get started right away with an example `evm` implementation following the steps as outlied in the tutorial but with RPC integration, Makefile and initialisation script of the blockchain.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tosch110/ethapp && cd ethapp
make install
./init.sh
ethappd start
```

This application is very close to the starport scaffold and has an empty module in the `ethapp/x` folder where you can start integrating your blockchain logic as in any starport scaffolded application.

## Creating our environment

If your blockchain is not already running `ethappd`, we start the blockchain with

```
starport serve --verbose
````

The `--verbose` flag is helpful in development and will show us if there are any errors in launching our blockchain application. From here we create our keys and fund them from the initial account that we created in the genesis block

Query for your account and balances

```bash
ethappcli q auth account $(ethappcli keys show user1 -a) -o text
```

## Uploading a contract

With having the `evm` module available we now can upload contracts with the `create` command. First, we have to compile our contract into bytecode. We will choose the [ERC777 contract from OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc777) as an exercise. It is the upgrade of the ERC20 and allows for Fungible Token creation and transfer.

In order to compile a smart contract to bytecode, we will be using Truffle.

Truffle allows us to work with a contract and compile it.

- [Install Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation)

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

First, let us setup our contract working repository 

```bash
mkdir erc777 && cd erc777
truffle init
```

First, let us install the Openzeppelin codebase with `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts`.

As preparation to use our blockchain with truffle, we make use of the `erc777/truffle-config.js`.

As network we use 

```javascript
  networks: {
    // Useful for testing. The `development` name is special - truffle uses it by default
    // if it's defined here and no other network is specified at the command line.
    // You should run a client (like ganache-cli, geth or parity) in a separate terminal
    // tab if you use this network and you must also set the `host`, `port` and `network_id`
    // options below to some value.
    //
    development: {
     host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
     port: 8545,            // Standard Ethereum port (default: none)
     network_id: "*",       // Any network (default: none)
    //  gas: 6000000,           // Gas sent with each transaction (default: ~6700000)
    //  gasPrice: 20000000000,  // 20 gwei (in wei) (default: 100 gwei)
    },
```

and as compiler we are using solidity version 0.6.2

```javascript
// Configure your compilers
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.6.2",    // Fetch exact version from solc-bin (default: truffle's version)
      // docker: true,        // Use "0.5.1" you've installed locally with docker (default: false)
      // settings: {          // See the solidity docs for advice about optimization and evmVersion
      //  optimizer: {
      //    enabled: false,
      //    runs: 200
      //  },
      //  evmVersion: "byzantium"
      // }
    },
  },
```

Next, we get into defining the code from our ERC777 contract, we already had a look above. As we are using the code from OpenZeppelin, we can simply create a contract with their battle-tested standard and define our Token details in our piece of code.

From here, we move into the `erc777/contracts` folder and create our own `token.sol` contract file.

In our `erc777/contracts/token.sol` file add

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.2;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC777/ERC777.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

/**
 * @title My Token
 * On-Blockchain Token in ERC777 Standard
 */
contract MyToken is ERC777 {
    constructor(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        uint256 initialSupply)

    ERC777(name, symbol, new address[](0))

    public{
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply, "", "");
    }
}
```

## Deployment

We have compiled our contract. Now we need to upload it to the blockchain.

Useful commands for deployment

Start rest server
```bash
ethappcli rest-server --laddr "tcp://localhost:8545" --trace --chain-id ethapp-1 --unlock-key user1
```

Migrate with truffle
```bash
truffle migrate --network development
```

When everything has been setup correctly, you should see an output like this

```bash
