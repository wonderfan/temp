### UI on Github Pages

Click the link below, and scroll down until you see it get her pages. Then, select the branch gh-pages.

Github Pages Setings: https://github.com/{username}/{repository}/settings/

After you do that you can visit your chain's UI at:

https://{username}.github.io/{repository}

This is especially useful when you would like to rapidly iterate on a live user interface. Remember, each community member can have their own github pages instance, allowing your community to mix-and-match front ends.
