# Wasm Smart Contracts Introduction

The `wasm` module enables smart contracts written in rust on your blockchain applications. Rust is a programming language that focuses on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Smart contracts can get uploaded on the blockchain by anyone and executed by anyone. The module will support validation of contracts and the output of their respective contract functions. It allows to use contract standards from the Ethereum Virtual Machine or deploying new contracts that you develop on your own.
