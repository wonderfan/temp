# Quickstart

With `starport` installed on your machine, you can now build your very first blockchain!

```
starport app github.com/username/myapp && cd myapp
```

This command will create a directory `myapp` and scaffold a Cosmos SDK blockchain.

```
starport serve
```

`serve` will install dependencies, build, initialise and run your blokchain.

```
starport type post title body
```

`type` scaffolds functionality to create, read, update and delete for a custom type.
